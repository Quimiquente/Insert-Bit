# Insert-Bit
Insert a bit in a random position of a given binary number. A binary number (<code>number</code>) is given to the function (<code>insert_bit()</code>) that calculates how many zeros and ones there are inside of it, and establish a difference between the too. For that, the number is turned into a string, enabling easy insertion of a bit into it. With the proportions of zeros and ones, it will determine what bit should be inserted, based on who has the least occurences. The number of bits will depend on difference between zeros and ones and the end goal is to balance the quantity of zeros and ones inside the number, reaching a proportion for both of 50%.
