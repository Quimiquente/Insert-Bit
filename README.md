# Insert-Bit
Insert a bit in a random place of a given binary number. Bit value will depend on whether there are mostly zeros or ones inside said binary number, and number of bits will depend on difference between zeros and ones. The objective is to balance the quantity of zeros and ones inside the number so they're the same.
